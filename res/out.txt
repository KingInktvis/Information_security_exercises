To err is human, but to err in cyber security can cause major damage to an
organization. It will never be possible to be perfect, but major improvement
is possible, just by being aware of some of the most common mistakes and their
consequences.



1. Falling for phishing: One of the most common mistakes.
2. Unauthorized application or cloud use, known as shadow IT.
3. Weak or misused passwords

   administrative privileges, to make things easier for employees 
6. Clueless social networking
7. Poor mobile security
8. Too many privileges
